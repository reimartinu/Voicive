# Voicive
Voicive is a app that allows you to:
* Record audio via the built-in microphone
* Detect the lowest pitch contained inside the audio-buffer
* Convert its frequency into a note according to a given tuning
* Send this pitch via USB-Midi to another device

The project is built using the Xamarin-Workload for Visual Studio 2022.
